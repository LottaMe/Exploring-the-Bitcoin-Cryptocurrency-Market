## What's the question of the project?

Considering the data on the cryptocurrency market, how safe are investments in the different currencies?

## Why is this an interesting question?

It is an interesting question for everyone interested in investing, but more importantly for people that don't know much about the market and might fall victim to false advertising or scams. 

## What methods are used to answer the question?

- reading data from csv
- selecting multiple columns
- counting number of values in columns
- query to filter dataframe
- selecting rows
- plotting graphs with pandas
- set index
- dealing with NaN -> dropping NaN
- Sorting values

## What are the most important results?

Most of the cryptocurrencies are small, only very few can be classified as bigger. The market fluctuates a lot, so making decisions on what to invest in can be considered dangerous.

## How do these results answer the question of the study?

The results highlight how fast the market changes for the many small cryptocurrencies, so that conclusions drawn from only on data point (e.g. percentage change in the last day) can be very misleading.

## Summarize your most important learnings

I think this guided projects compliments the ones I have done before, as it practices methods that were not practiced much in the other projects. I haven't used query much before, so working more with that was very good practice.
